    <p> Upcoming galaxy surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), Euclid, Roman will provide data that cover large volume and high precision. A powerful tool to connect the observable universe with the underlying physics are N-point statistics, which depend on the value of the density field at N different points in space. <b>N-point statistics</b> are cosmoloigcal bridge, whose foundations are based on the imprints left over by various physical processes on the large-scale clustering pattern. </p>

<h2> 4-Point Functions to Probe Cosmoloigcal Parity </h2>
<img src="tet_4pcf.png" alt="EU Logo" width="400" />
<p>  A parity transformation applied to a tetrahedron formed by a quartet of galaxies. Each vertex represents a galaxy. Choosing one galaxy (red dot) as our primary, the quartet is defined by the three vectors to the remaining vertices r<sub>i</sub>, for i=1,2,3. An effective handedness can be assigned to the vertex based on the ordering of the three side lengths. When applying a parity transformation to the galaxy quadruplet, the handedness of the given vertex is flipped along the dotted mirror plane. </p>

<h2> Skew Spectra: Optimal Compressed 3-Point Statistics for Cosmology </h2>
<img src="skewspec_sketch.png" alt="EU Logo" width="400" />
<p>  By optimally weighting a pair of density field and cross-correlating with a single density field, we can construct efficient statistics that have power spectrum like structure, but at the same time, encode 3-point statistics information. </p>

<h2> Fast Algorithm for the NPCFs </h2> 
<img src="timing_4PCF_IsoFunc_BruteForce_comparison.pdf" alt="EU Logo" width="400" />
<p> Comparison of computational cost between the spherical-harmonic-based NPCF algorithms using the spherical harmonics decomposition approach versus brute force. The dashed lines indicate a power-law extrapolation of the brute-force approach, which would make the NPCF almost infeasible for modern galaxy surveys. </p>
